# Mongo Autopilot API

This is a simple Autopilot Node API that displays users and allows additional users to to be added to the system.

MongoDB and Node must be installed prior to running

To setup simply clone the repo and run:
```
npm i
```
To start the server run:
```
npm run start
```
To test while the app is running run:
```
npm test
```
To run the linter run:
```
npm run lint
```
I wanted to get the API running with mongoose so I used the help of few Scotch guides in setting up and testing the API.

All GET/POST methods were tested real time using Postman.

This was the first time integrating Mongoose, it was good to see it in action compared to Postgresql.
